       Version Information
       qstat --version


DESCRIPTION
       The qstat command displays the status of jobs, queues, or servers, writing the status information to standard output.

       When  displaying job status information, the qstat command displays status information about all specified jobs, job arrays, and
       subjobs.  You can specify jobs by ID, or by destination, for example all jobs at a specified queue or server.

       Display Formats
       You can use particular options to display status information in a default  format,  an  alternate  format,  or  a  long  format.
       Default  and  alternate formats display all status information for a job, queue, or server with one line per object, in columns.
       Long formats display status information showing all attributes, one attribute to a line.

       Displaying Information for Finished and Moved Jobs
       You can display status information for finished and moved jobs by using the -x and -H options.

       If your job has been moved to another server through peer scheduling, give the job ID as an argument to qstat.  If  you  do  not
       specify  the  job  ID, your job will not appear to exist.  For example, your job 123.ServerA is moved to ServerB.  In this case,
       you can use
          qstat 123
       or
          qstat 123.ServerA

       Specifying the full job name, including the server, avoids the possibility that qstat will report on  a  job  named  123.ServerB
       that was moved to ServerA.

       To list all jobs at ServerB, you can use:
          qstat @ServerB

       Displaying Truncated Data
       When  the  number of characters required would exceed the space available, qstat truncates the output and puts an asterisk ("*")
       in the last position.  For example, in default job display format, there are three characters allowed for the number  of  cores.
       If the actual output were 1234 , the value displayed would be 12* instead.

       Required Privilege
       Users without Manager or Operator privilege cannot view resources or attributes that are invisible to unprivileged users.


DISPLAYING JOB STATUS
       Job Status in Default Format
       Triggers: no options, or any of the -J, -p, -t, or -x options.

       The  qstat  command displays job status in default format when you specify no options, or any of the -J, -p, -t, or -x, options.
       Jobs are displayed one to a line, with these column headers:

       Job ID   Name       User      Time Use S Queue

       Complete                                this field is "0". At the point where
                                               the application starts accumulating
                                               cput, this field changes to "00:00:00".
                                               After that, every time the MoM polls
                                               for resource usage, the field is
                                               updated.

                                               The MoM on each execution host polls
                                               for the usage of all processes on her
                                               host belonging to the job.  Usage is
                                               summed.  The polling interval is short
                                               when a job first starts running and
                                               lengthens to a maximum of 2 minutes.

                                               If you specify -p, the Time Use column
                                               is replaced with the percentage
                                               completed for the job.  For a job array
                                               this is the percentage of subjobs
                                               completed.  For a normal job, it is the
                                               percentage of allocated CPU time used.

       Job Status in Long Format
       Trigger: the -f option.
       If you specify the -f (full) option, full job status information for each job is displayed in this order:
            The job ID
            Each job attribute, one to a line
            The job's submission arguments
            The job's executable, in JSDL format
            The executable's argument list, in JSDL format

       The job attributes are listed as <name> = <value> pairs. This includes the exec_host and exec_vnode strings.   The  full  output
       can be very large.


       The exec_host string has the format:
       <host1>/<T1>*<P1>[+<host2>/<T2>*<P2>+...]
       where
       T1 is the task slot number (the index) of the job on hostA.
       P1 is the number of processors allocated to the job from host1.  The number of processors allocated does not appear if it is 1.

       The exec_vnode string has the format:
       (<vnode1>:ncpus=<N1>:mem=<M1>)[+(<vnode2>:ncpus=<N2>:mem=<M2>)+...]
       where
       N1 is the number of CPUs allocated to that job on vnode1.
       M1 is the amount of memory allocated to that job on vnode1.

       Job Status in Alternate Format
       Triggers: any of the -a, -i, -G, -H, -M, -n, -r, -s, -T, or -u <user list> options.
       The  qstat  command displays job status in the alternate format if you specify any of the -a, -i, -G, -H, -M, -n, -r, -s, -T, or
       -u <user list> options.  Jobs are displayed one to a line.  If jobs are running and the -n option is specified, or if  jobs  are
       finished or moved and the -H and -n options are specified, there is a second line for the exec_host string.

                                               replacing the Elap Time field with the
                                               Est Start Time field.


Grouping Jobs and Sorting by ID
       Trigger: the -E option.
       You  can use the -E option to sort and group jobs in the output of qstat.  The -E option groups jobs by server and displays each
       group by ascending ID.  This option also improves qstat performance.  The following table shows how the -E  option  affects  the
       behavior of qstat:

       How qstat is Used    Result Without -E           Result With -E

       -----------------------------------------------------------------------



DISPLAYING QUEUE STATUS
       Queue Status in Default Format
       Trigger: the -Q option by itself.
       The  qstat command displays queue status in the default format if the only option is -Q.  Queue status is displayed one queue to
       a line, with these column headers:

       Queue Max  Tot  Ena  Str Que  Run  Hld  Wat  Trn  Ext  Type
       ----- ---- ---- ---- --- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

       Description of columns:

       Trn            Number of jobs being moved (transiting)

       Ext            Number of exiting jobs

       Type           Type of queue: execution or routing



       Queue Status in Long Format
       Trigger: the -q and -f options together.
       If you specify the -f (full) option with the -q option, full queue status information for each queue is displayed starting  with
       the queue name, followed by each attribute, one to a line, as <name> = <value> pairs.


       Queue Status: Alternate Format
       Triggers: any of the -q, -G, or -M options.
       The  qstat  command displays queue status in the alternate format if you specify any of the -q, -G, or -M options.  Queue status
       is displayed one queue to a line, and the lowest line contains totals for some columns.

       These are the alternate format queue status column headers:

       Queue Memory CPU Time Walltime Node Run Que Lm State
       ----- ------ -------- -------- ---- --- --- -- -----

       Description of columns:

       Queue          Queue name

       Memory         Maximum amount of memory that can be requested by a job in this queue

       CPU Time       Maximum amount of CPU time that can be requested by a job in this queue

       Walltime       Maximum amount of walltime that can be requested by a job in this queue

       Node           Maximum number of vnodes that can be requested by a job in this queue

       Run            Number of running and suspended jobs.  Lowest row is total number of running and suspended jobs in all the queues
                      shown

       Que            Number  of  queued,  waiting, and held jobs.  Lowest row is total number of queued, waiting, and held jobs in all
                      the queues shown

       Lm             Maximum number of jobs allowed to run concurrently in this queue

       State          State of this queue: E (enabled) or D (disabled), and R (running) or S (stopped)





DISPLAYING SERVER STATUS
       Server Status in Default Format:
       Trigger: the -B option.
       The qstat command displays server status if the only option given is -B.

       Column headers for default server status output:

       Server Max Tot Que Run Hld Wat Trn Ext Status
       ------ --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ------

       Description of columns:

       Server         Name of server

       Max            Maximum number of jobs allowed to be running concurrently on the server

       Tot            Total number of jobs currently managed by the server

       Que            Number of queued jobs

       Run            Number of running jobs

       Hld            Number of held jobs

       Status         Status of the server

       Server Status in Long Format
       Trigger: the -f option.
       If you specify the -f (full) option, displays full server status information starting with the server  name,  followed  by  each
       server attribute, one to a line, as <name> = <value> pairs. Includes PBS version information.



OPTIONS
       Generic Job Status Options

       -E        Groups jobs by server and displays jobs sorted by ascending ID.  When qstat is presented with a list of jobs, jobs are
                 grouped by server and each group is displayed by ascending ID.  This option also improves qstat performance.

       Default Job Status Options

       -J        Prints status information for job arrays (not subjobs).

       -t        Displays status information for jobs, job arrays, and subjobs.  When used with -J option,  prints  status  information
                 for subjobs only.


       -p        The Time Use column is replaced with the percentage completed for the job.  For an array job this is the percentage of
                 subjobs completed.  For a normal job, it is the percentage of allocated CPU time used.


       -x        Displays status information for finished and moved jobs in addition to queued and running jobs.

       Alternate Job Status Options

       -a        All queued and running jobs are displayed.  If a destination is specified, information for all jobs at  that  destina‐
                 tion  is  displayed.   If  a job ID is specified, information about that job is displayed.  Always specify this option
                 before the -n or -s options, otherwise they will not take effect.


       -H        Without a job identifier, displays information for all finished or moved jobs.  If a job ID is given, displays  infor‐
                 mation  for  that  job  regardless  of its state.  If a destination is specified, displays information for finished or
                 moved jobs, or specified job(s), at destination.


       -i        If a destination is given, information for queued, held or waiting jobs at that destination is displayed.  If a job ID
                 is given, information about that job is displayed regardless of its state.


       -n        The  exec_host  string  is  listed  on the line below the basic information.  If the -1 option is given, the exec_host
                 string is listed on the end of the same line.  If using the -a option, always specify the -n option after  -a,  other‐
                 wise the -n option does not take effect.


       -r        If a destination is given, information for running or suspended jobs at that destination is displayed.  If a job ID is
                 given, information about that job is displayed regardless of its state.


       -s        Any comment added by the administrator or scheduler is shown on the line below  the  basic  information.   If  the  -1
                 option is given, the comment string is listed on the end of the same line.  If using the -a option, always specify the
                 -s option after -a, otherwise the -s option does not take effect.


       -T        Displays estimated start time for queued jobs, replacing the Elap Time field with the Est Start Time field.  Jobs with
                 earlier estimated start times are displayed before those with later estimated start times.

                 Running jobs are displayed before other jobs.  Running jobs are sorted by their stime attribute (start time).

                 Queued  jobs whose estimated start times are unset (estimated.start_time = unset) are displayed after those with esti‐
                 mated start times, with estimated start time shown as a double dash ("--").  Queued jobs with estimated start times in
                 the past are treated as if their estimated start times are unset.

                 If a job's estimated start time cannot be calculated, the start time is shown as a question mark ("?").

                 Time displayed is local to the qstat command.  Current week begins on Sunday.

                 The following table shows the format for the Est Start Time field when the -w option is not used:



                 Format         Job's Estimated Start Time             Example

                 The following table shows the format for the Est Start Time field when the -w option is used:

                 When used with the -f option, prints the full timezone-qualified start time.

                 Estimated start time information can be made unavailable to unprivileged users; in this case, the estimated start time
                 appears to be unset.


       -u <user list>
                 If a destination is given, status for jobs at that destination owned by users in <user list> is displayed.  If  a  job
                 ID is given, status information for that job is displayed regardless of the job's ownership.

                 Format: <username>[@<hostname>][, <username>[@<hostname>], ...]  in comma-separated list.

                 Hostnames may be wildcarded, but not domain names.  When no hostname is specified, username is for any host.


       -w        Can  be  used  with job status in default and alternate formats.  Allows display of wider fields up to 120 characters.
                 See Job Status in Default Format and Job Status in Alternate Format for column widths.

                 This option is different from the -w option used with the -f long-format option.


       -1 (hyphen one)
                 Reformats qstat output to a single line.  Can be used only in conjunction with the -n and/or -s options.


       Queue Status Options

       -Q        Displays queue status in default format.  Operands must be destinations.

       -q        Displays queue status in alternate format.  Operands must be destinations.


       Server Status Options

       -B        Display server status.  Operands must be names of servers.


       Job, Queue, and Server Status Options

       -f [-w]   Full display for long format. Job, queue or server attributes displayed one to a line.
                 JSON output: PBS reports resources_used values for resources that are created or set in a hook as JSON strings in  the
                 output of qstat -f.

                 If MoM returns a JSON object (a Python dictionary), PBS reports the value as a string in single quotes:
                 resources_used.<resource_name> = '{ <mom_JSON_item_value>, <mom_JSON_item_value>, <mom_JSON_item_value>, ..}'
                 Example:  MoM returns { "a":1, "b":2, "c":1,"d": 4} for resources_used.foo_str.  We get:
                 resources_used.foo_str='{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c":1,"d": 4}'

                 If MoM returns a value that is not a valid JSON object, the value is reported verbatim.
                 Example: MoM returns "hello"  for resources_used.foo_str.  We get:
                 resources_used.foo_str="hello"

                 Optional -w prints each attribute on one unbroken line.  Feed characters are converted:
                    Newline is converted to backslash concatenated with "n", resulting in "\n"
                    Form feed is converted to backslash concatenated with "f", resulting in "\f"
                 This -w is independent of the -w job output option used with default and alternate formats.


       -F dsv [-D <delimiter>]

                 Prints  output in delimiter-separated value format.  The default delimiter is a pipe ("|").  You can specify a charac‐
                 ter or a string delimiter using the -D argument to the -F dsv option.  For example, to use a comma as the delimeter:
                    qstat -f -F dsv -D,
                 If the delimiter itself appears in a value, it is escaped:
                    On Linux, the delimiter is escaped with a backslash ("\").
                    On Windows, the delimiter is escaped with a caret ("^").

                 Feed characters are converted:
                    Newline is converted to backslash concatenated with "n", resulting in "\n"
                    Form feed is converted to backslash concatenated with "f", resulting in "\f"

                 A newline separates each job from the next.  Using newline as the delimiter leads to undefined behavior.

                 Example of getting output in delimiter-separated value format:
                    qstat -f -Fdsv

                    Job Id: 1.vbox|Job_Name = STDIN|Job_Owner = root@vbox|job_state  =  Q|queue  =  workq|server  =  vbox|Checkpoint  =
                    u|ctime = Fri Nov 11 17:57:05 2016|Error_Path = ...


       -F json   Prints  output in JSON format (http://www.json.org/).  Attribute output is preceded by timestamp, PBS version, and PBS
                 server hostname.  Example:

                    qstat -f F json

                    {
                            "timestamp":1479277336,
                            "pbs_version":"14.1",
                            "pbs_server":"vbox",
                            "Jobs":{
                                    "1.vbox":{
                                            "Job_Name":"STDIN",
                                            "Job_Owner":"root@vbox",
                                            "job_state":"Q",



       -G        Shows size in gigabytes.  Triggers alternate format.

       -M        Shows size in megawords.  A word is considered to be 8 bytes.  Triggers alternate format.


       Version Information

       --version
               The qstat command returns its PBS version information and exits.  This option can only be used alone.



OPERANDS
       Job Identifier Operands
       The job ID is assigned by PBS at submission.  Job IDs are used only with job status requests.  Status information for  specified
       job(s) is displayed.  Formats:

       Job            <sequence number>[.<server>][@<server>]

       Job array      <sequence number>[][.<server>][@<server>]

       Subjob         <sequence number>[<index>][.<server>][@<server>]

       Range of subjobs
                      <sequence number>[<start>-<end>][.<server>][@<server>]

       Note that some shells require that you enclose a job array identifier in double quotes.


       Destination Operands
       Name of queue, name of server, or name of queue at a specific server.  Formats:

       queue name     Specifies name of queue for job or queue display.
                         When displaying job status, PBS displays status for all jobs in the specified queue at the default server.
                         When displaying queue status, PBS displays status for the specified queue at the default server.

       queue name@server name
                      Specifies name of queue at server for job or queue display.
                         When displaying job status, PBS displays status for all jobs in the specified queue at the specified server.
                         When displaying queue status, PBS displays status for the specified queue at the specified server.

       @server name   Specifies server name for job or queue display.
                         When displaying job status, PBS displays status for all jobs at all queues at the specified server.
                         When displaying queue status, PBS displays status for all queues at the specified server.

       server name    Specifies server name for server display.
                         When displaying server status (with the -B option) PBS displays status for the specified server.

STANDARD ERROR
